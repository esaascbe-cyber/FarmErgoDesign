FarmErgoDesign: Indian Agriculture Population's Anthropometric Data Viewer
It is Farmer + Ergo + Design = Farmer Go Design
FarmErgoDesign is an intuitive tool that bridges the gap between farmers, ergonomics, and design. The name itself represents the synergy between Farmer, Ergonomics, and Design, embodying the essence of "Farmer Go Design."

This application provides comprehensive access to the anthropometric and strength data of Indian agricultural workers, derived from the authoritative study by the Central Institute of Agricultural Engineering (CIAE), Bhopal. FarmErgoDesign allows users to explore, analyze, and utilize this crucial data to inform the design of farm equipment and tools, ensuring they are tailored to the physical characteristics of the Indian farming population.

With an easy-to-use interface, users can search for specific anthropometric parameters, explore applications in design, and visualize data across different regions. Whether you're a designer, researcher, or policymaker, FarmErgoDesign empowers you to create more ergonomic, efficient, and user-friendly agricultural tools and machinery.
